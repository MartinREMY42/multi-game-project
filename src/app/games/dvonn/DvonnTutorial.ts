        If no number is indicated on a stack, it means that it only contains one piece.
        The number written on a stack indicates the number of pieces within that stack, hence the number of points its owner gets.
        The owner of a stack is the one that has a piece at the top of the stack.
        Only the owner of a stack can move it.
        A stack cannot be moved if it is surrounded by 6 other stacks.
        A stack is moved by as many spaces as there are pieces within, in a straight line, and it should land on an occupied space.
        This line cannot move along the vertex of two neighboring spaces, as would a vertical move.
