        <source>Awal√© is a game of distribution (sowing) and capture. Its goal is to capture the most seeds.
         Let&apos;s see how seeds are sown.
         As you&apos;re playing first, the 6 houses on the top are yours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <source>Look at the 4 houses that follow clockwise the one you picked, they now contain 5 seeds.

        one by one from the house next to the one they come from, clockwise.</source>

        <source>After sowing, if the last seed falls in an opponent&apos;s house and if there is now two or three seeds in this house, the player captures these two or three seeds.
         Then, the player looks at the preceding house:
         if it is still in the opponent&apos;s side and contains two or three seeds, they are also captured.
         This continues until we reach either the player&apos;s side or a house containing neither two nor three seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        <source>At Dvonn, each hexagonal space contains a stack of pieces.
        If no number is indicated on a stack, it means that it only contains one piece.
        The number written on a stack indicates the number of pieces within that stack, hence the number of points its owner gets.
        The owner of a stack is the one that has a piece at the top of the stack.
        Only the owner of a stack can move it.
        A stack cannot be moved if it is surrounded by 6 other stacks.
        A stack is moved by as many spaces as there are pieces within, in a straight line, and it should land on an occupied space.
        This line cannot move along the vertex of two neighboring spaces, as would a vertical move.
        Therefore, there are six possible directions.
        The player with dark pieces starts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        <source>To capture, you must align 4 of your own pieces, which will be the first 4 captured pieces.
        There are multiple important aspects of a capture:
        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;When 4 pieces are captured, all pieces that are directly aligned with these 4 pieces are also captured.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;As soon as there is an empty space on the line, the capture stops.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Your own pieces that are captured go back to your stock.
                Your opponent&apos;s pieces however are really captured and do not go back to your opponent&apos;s stock.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;If you create a line of 4 of your opponent&apos;s pieces, it will be at the beginning of your opponent&apos;s turn that your opponent can capture them.
                This means that a turn happens in three phases:
                &lt;ol type=&quot;A&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;Pick the capture(s) resulting from the last move of your opponent (by clicking on it).&lt;/li&gt;

        <source>The game of Go is played on a board called a Goban, and the stones are placed on the intersections.
        The traditional board is made of 19x19 intersections, but on this website we have the 13x13 board.
        (For shorter parts, 9x9 and 5x5 boards exist, but are not yet available here).

        <source>The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.
        We call &quot;territories&quot; the intersections that are empty and isolated from the rest of the Goban by the stones of a single player.
        Here, Dark has 9 territories on the left, and Light has 8 on the right.
        The top part belongs to no one.
        Each player&apos;s score at the end of the game is the sum of that player&apos;s territories and captures.</source>

        If Dark plays on the last liberty of the light stone, this stone is removed from the Goban (captured) and Dark earns one point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

        In this case, we say that Light has only one eye (its last liberty) and that Light is dead (even if not yet captured).

        This rule is called the Ko.

            &lt;li&gt;Click on one of your pieces or on a neutral one. You cannot choose a piece of the opponent.
                You can only choose a piece from the edge of the board.&lt;/li&gt;

        You have to imagine that the piece you picked has been moved to the other side of the board, in the chosen direction.
        Once on the other side, all pieces will move by one space in the opposing direction.
        Afterwards, if the piece was neutral, it will become yours and takes your color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;Your piece must already be oriented in the direction of the push.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The number of the pieces (opponent&apos;s or not) that are facing yours (called the resistants)
                must be smaller than the number of pieces that are oriented in the same direction as the push, yourself included (the pushers).&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;The number of mountains on that line must be smaller or equal to the difference between the pushers and the resistants.&lt;/li&gt;

        Your piece on the top right cannot push because there is one mountain too much.

        <source>Tablut is a strategy game that was played by the Vikings.
        The goal of the game is different for each player.
        The attacker plays first. Its pieces (dark) are close to the edges.
        Its goal is to capture the king, which is in the center of the board.
        The defender plays second. Its pieces (light) are in the middle.
        Its goal is to put the king on one of the 4 thrones in the corners.
        Note that the square in which the king starts, in the center of the board, is also a throne.</source>

        <source>All pieces move the same way.
        Similarly to a rook in chess, a piece can move:
        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;By as many squares as you want.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Without going over another piece or stopping on another piece.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Horizontally or vertically.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Only the king can land on a throne.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        To move a piece, click on it and then on its landing square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        This is the initial board, do the first move.</source>

        A ring cannot pass through other rings during its move.
        If it goes over a group of markers, your move must stop at the first empty space after that group.

        You will then have one more point.
